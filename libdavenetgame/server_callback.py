## This class implements the basic server callback object.  You should inherit this class and add methods
#  as needed to respond to callbacks.  The callbacks themselves will come from within the same thread as
#  your game loop, so you will have to call update() on the callback object.
#
#  To start a basic server, you'd do something like this:
#  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
#  from libdavenetgame import server_callback
#   
#  HOST = ''   # Symbolic name meaning all available interfaces
#  PORT = 8888 # Arbitrary non-privileged port
#  
#  theServer = server_callback.ServerCallback(host = HOST,
#                                          port = PORT)
#  theServer.StartServer()
#  keepGoing = True
#  
#  try:
#      while(keepGoing) :
#          theServer.Update(time.time() )
#          
#  except exceptions.KeyboardInterrupt:
#      print "Quitting due to keyboard interrupt"
#  
#  theServer.Stop()
#  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
#  For something a bit more advanced, you'd inherit ServerCallback, overload any methods you need, including any
#  required methods, then simply call Update() from inside your game loop to update the server.  That gets your callbacks
#  called, syncs game objects, and lets you continue running your simulation.
#
#  The network layer itself runs in its own thread, and from there it maintains connections, pinging clients periodically,
#  and sending/receiving all network messages.  Then it queues up the callbacks so that they can be safely run
#  in your main thread.
