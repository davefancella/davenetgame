## This file lists all of the message types including their unique IDs.  When you create a new
#  message type, you must add it to this file before it can be sent/received over the network.
#  The actual order of messages here doesn't matter, since we're using a dict to store them all, but
#  for readability's sake, try to keep them in reasonable order.
#
#  You must make two entries for every type.  One entry is keyed by number and has the type as the value,
#  and the other entry is keyed by the string for the type and has the number as the value.  You must
#  also make the constant for the type, using that constant in your two entries.
