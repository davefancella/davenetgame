## @file
#
#  This file contains the TransportBase class from which all transports must inherit.  In order
#  for a client-server connection to be made, the client has to have a ClientProtocol associated
#  with a transport derived from TransportBase, and the server has to have a ServerProtocol
#  associated with a transport as well.  All the transport does is send and receive messages.
#  When a message is received, it will call a message callback that the Protocol object must
#  implement.  When a message is sent, the Protocol object must tell the transport layer where
#  it is going.  For UDP connections, a host:port pair is needed.  For TCP connections, a socket
#  is needed.  This information is stored in the Connection object.
#
#  Currently, only UDP is implemented.
