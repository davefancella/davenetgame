## @file
#
#  This file implements the callback interface used to inform games that they've received net
#  events.  The game can provide their own functions/methods to be called, but for the most 
#  part, inheriting nClientCallback and nServerCallback should be sufficient.
#
#  The Callback class is used internally only and should not be used by games.
#
#  Your callback's name should be the message or event to which it applies.  For example, if you
#  want to respond to Chat messages, the name of that message will be "chat", so your callback
#  should be named "chat".  Callbacks without names will never be called.
#
#  Regardless of where your callback will be called from, it will be passed a list of keyword
#  arguments.  If your callback is used to process network messages, the arguments will be the
#  actual members of the message.  In other situations, the callback arguments will be specified
#  by the documentation for the appropriate situation.

## The callback list object.  This object stores a list of callbacks.  It is used internally
#  to store registered callbacks by the Transport object as well as the Protocol object.  It
#  can be used by an EventDispatcher object as well, but is not required.
#
#  By default, callbacks are stored as lists for the event to which they refer.  This means
#  that multiple callbacks can be registered for the same event, and they will be called in
#  arbitrary order, unless specified otherwise by callback options.
