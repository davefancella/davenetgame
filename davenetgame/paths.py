## @file
#
#  A number of convenience functions that simplify cross-platform path issues.
#
#  This is a module that is optional for your use and is provided as a convenience, since
#  Python's "batteries included" philosophy sometimes leaves a bit to be desired.  Most of this
#  module provides convenience functions that wrap Python functions to execute common tasks,
#  but the most useful part of this module is the capability to provide access to game
#  resources without having to consider the underlying directory structure of the platform.
#  That makes the most useful function GetPath, which takes a simple string such as "graphic"
#  or "sound_effect" and returns the actual on-disk path to the file you're looking for.  For
#  GetPath to be effective, the module must be initialized by calling InitializePaths, which
#  tries to find out where the app exists and setup the resource paths accordingly.
#
#  This module is both stable and half-baked, at present time.  Luckily, the Network stuff,
#  i.e. the reason you want to use this library, doesn't use this module at all.  It is provided
#  strictly for your convenience.  I've not personally seen any game engine or GUI toolkit
#  provide the basic functionality given here, so I've included it in this library so you can
#  use it.

#  @param path : the path to list
#  @param includeDirs : if True, the list will include directories, but not the . and .. directories.
#  @param includeFiles : if True, the list will include filenames.
#  @return A list of everything asked for.

## Returns the directory to a file.  It should be everything up to the file, e.g. /usr/bin/python would
#  return /usr/bin
#  @param path : the path to the file.
#  @return the directory.

#  unavailable, it'll return "Player 1", because that's funny.

## Return the asset path desired.  If targetFile is not none, then it will join the filename to the asset path,
# returning a complete path to the file you want.  This allows you to open app asset files in a cross-platform
# way, run from the source directory, etc.  When you specify a targetFile, the string returned can be
# passed directly to open().
# @param path the program asset path desired, such as 'resource', 'civilizations', or 'flags'.
# @param targetFile Filename to join to the asset path, in which case the path returned points
#                               at this file.  Defaults to None.
# @return the path to the asset directory, with or without the filename you're wanting.
