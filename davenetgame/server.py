## This file contains the basic Server class, which creates a UDP server capable of handling multiple
#  connections.  It allows unauthenticated access to a Lobby and can transfer to a Game.  Authentication
#  should be handled by a subclass or something like that.

from davenetgame import pedia
from davenetgame import network

## This class implements the game server network layer.  It maintains the connections with
#  each client and does the final encoding of each outgoing packet and decoding of incoming
#  packets.  It handles basic login events, but does not handle more complex login protocols.
#
#  It also supports a basic set of callbacks to handle various low-level chores, such as pings, 
#  and callbacks for login/logout events so that you can implement your
#  own protocols for such things.  For most use cases, the standard callbacks should suffice.
#  In the event that you need to customize those callbacks, do so in the server_callback
#  interface and leave this one alone.
