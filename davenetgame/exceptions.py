import exceptions

## @file
#
#  This file contains the exceptions used by the library.  A few standard exceptions are also put here,
#  with the hope that an app developer will only ever need to import this file for exceptions.

## Transparently pass this exception on to the rest of the library.
#KeyboardInterrupt = exceptions.KeyboardInterrupt

## The base class for all library exceptions
class dngException(Exception):
    pass

## This exception is thrown when a required callback method hasn't been implemented.
class dngCallbackNotImplemented(dngException, NotImplementedError):
    pass

## Thrown when someone tries to set an nSyncObject's attribute to a type that is not compatible
#  with the declared type when the attribute was declared.
class dngSyncAttributeTypeError(dngException, TypeError):
    pass

## Thrown when someone tries to add an attribute to an nSyncObject that has already been added.
class dngSyncObjectAttributeError(dngException, Exception):
    pass
