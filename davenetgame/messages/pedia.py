## This class is the master list of all messages.  If you want to create a message, you have to get the
#  type from here.  If you want to decode a message, you give this class the message type ID and you get
#  an opaque message of the correct type that can then decode the message.  So, this is the Encyclopedia
#  of Messages.
#
#  It is implemented as a singleton, so you must use the get method to get it.  The first time this
#  module is imported, it will create the pedia.
